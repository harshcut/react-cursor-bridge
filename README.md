### Introduction

Capture screenshots, detect React elements, and send visual context with source code references directly to your editor.

React Cursor Bridge is a companion devtool that helps you send visual context and source code references from your browser to Cursor IDE. The extension works in the background to detect React components on the current page and resolve their source file paths. When you capture a region of the page, the side panel will expand to show a detailed overview of the detected components, including their source files and line numbers grouped by file. You can then write a prompt and send it to Cursor along with the screenshot and source paths via a deeplink.
